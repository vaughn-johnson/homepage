        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi! I am a software developer and a trained
        statistician. I have years of experience working on a product
        obsessed team, and I have a background in linguistics and physics.
      </p>

      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I value simplicity, legibility, and maintainability, and I
        embody those values in my work. My passion is helping people make
        decisions based on evidence.
